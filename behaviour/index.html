    <p class="mainP">To ensure the health and wellbeing of your guinea pig, it is essential to learn about its behavior. By recognizing its behavioral patterns, you can identify any unusual behavior, potential needs, and moods your guinea pig may be trying to communicate to you. Guinea pigs are curious and inquisitive creatures by nature, and they can be creatures of habit, so introducing changes in routine gradually is recommended.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs are most active during dawn and twilight hours. They also groom themselves regularly.</p>
    <p class="mainP">When picking up a guinea pig, it is normal for it to run away and hide as a natural defense mechanism. It is essential to deal with this patiently, and over time, most guinea pigs will come to accept being picked up.</p>
    <p class="mainP">When hungry or anticipating a treat, your pet may start "wheeking" and stand on its hind legs in excitement, focusing its eager eyes on you in the hope that you will notice its needs. Guinea pigs may also exhibit a behavior called "popcorning," which involves hopping in the air, running around, quickly turning in another direction, and repeating the jump repeatedly. This behavior is usually observed in young guinea pigs and is a sign of happiness, excitement, or playfulness.</p>

    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs may also run laps around their cage, as they do not use exercise wheels. When sensing danger or feeling uncertain, guinea pigs may freeze and stand motionless. They also sniff their surroundings to learn about their environment and potential food sources.</p>
    <p class="mainP">To mark their territory or items as their property, guinea pigs rub their chins, cheeks, and hind ends on them. Fidgeting while being held may indicate that your pet needs to go to the bathroom or is tired of being held, and it is recommended to return them to their cage for a moment to recuperate.</p>
    <p class="mainP">If a guinea pig tosses its head up in the air, it may be annoyed with being petted and asking its owner to stop. Licking may indicate personal affection or an affinity for the salt on the owner's skin. Teeth chattering is a sign of anger, and biting can occur for several reasons, including fear, annoyance, or skin problems like mites. Nibbling is a way of communication, especially for young guinea pigs, and biting the cage bars can be triggered by various factors.</p>
