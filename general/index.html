    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs, also known as cavy, are popular domestic pets around the world. They are small, sociable rodents that are native to South America, where they were first domesticated by the Inca people. Guinea pigs are herbivorous, and their diet mainly consists of hay, pellets, vegetables, and fruits. They have a lifespan of 4 to 8 years and can weigh between 1 to 3 pounds.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs are social animals and are often kept in pairs or groups. They communicate with each other through various vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. They are active during the day and usually sleep for short periods of time throughout the day. Guinea pigs are also known for their ability to jump, run, and play, which makes them an entertaining pet to watch.</p>
    <p class="mainP">In the wild, guinea pigs live in groups of up to 10 individuals and establish a hierarchy within the group. Dominant males will defend their territory and mate with multiple females, while subordinate males may form alliances to challenge the alpha male for dominance. Guinea pigs are prey animals and are known for their skittish behavior, which helps them avoid predators in the wild.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs have a relatively low-maintenance lifestyle, but they do require some basic care. Their cages should be kept clean and well-ventilated, and they should have access to fresh water and a balanced diet. They also need plenty of exercise and social interaction to stay healthy and happy. Guinea pigs have sensitive respiratory systems and can be prone to respiratory infections, so it is important to keep their environment clean and free from dust and other irritants.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs may also run laps around their cage, as they do not use exercise wheels. When sensing danger or feeling uncertain, guinea pigs may freeze and stand motionless. They also sniff their surroundings to learn about their environment and potential food sources.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Overall, guinea pigs make great pets for those who are looking for a small, sociable, and entertaining animal to share their home with. They are easy to care for, have distinct personalities, and can bring joy and companionship to their owners for many years.</p>
