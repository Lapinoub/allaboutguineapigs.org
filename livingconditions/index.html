    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs are social animals that require specific living conditions to remain healthy and happy. Therefore, it is recommended to keep at least two guinea pigs together to provide socialization and companionship. </p>
    <p class="mainP">The flooring of the cage should be safe and comfortable for guinea pigs. Solid flooring made of materials like plastic or metal can cause foot problems and discomfort. A solid bottom with a layer of bedding made of materials like wood shavings, paper-based products, or fleece should be used instead. The bedding should be changed frequently to maintain a clean and healthy environment.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs need a variety of enrichment activities to keep them physically and mentally stimulated. Toys like tunnels, chew toys, and hiding places should be provided to encourage exploration and play. Guinea pigs also need access to hay, fresh vegetables, and water at all times.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Temperature and humidity are important factors to consider when creating living conditions for guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are sensitive to extreme temperatures and should be kept in a space that is between 60-75Â°F. They also require a low humidity environment to avoid respiratory problems.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs require a clean and well-ventilated living space. The cage should be cleaned regularly to prevent the buildup of waste and bacteria. Ventilation should be provided through the use of air vents or fans to ensure proper air circulation. When keeping multiple guinea pigs together, it is important to provide additional living space to accommodate their needs. A minimum of 10.5 square feet of living space is recommended for two guinea pigs, with an additional 1-2 square feet per additional guinea pig.</p>
    <p class="mainP">When introducing new guinea pigs to an established group, it is important to do so gradually to avoid stress or aggression. A separate area can be provided for the new guinea pig, and introductions should be supervised to ensure they are getting along well.</p>
    <p class="mainP">In summary, guinea pigs require a spacious and safe living environment with comfortable flooring, plenty of enrichment activities, access to food and water, and proper temperature and humidity. It is recommended to keep at least two guinea pigs together to provide socialization and companionship, with additional living space provided accordingly. Regular cleaning and ventilation are also necessary to keep them healthy and happy.</p>
