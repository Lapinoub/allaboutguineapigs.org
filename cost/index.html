    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs are relatively inexpensive pets to acquire, but the cost of owning one over its lifetime can add up. In this section, we will discuss the costs associated with owning a guinea pig and their maintenance requirements.</p>
    <p class="mainP">The initial cost of acquiring a guinea pig can vary depending on where you obtain it. Some pet stores and breeders sell them for as little as $20, while others may charge upwards of $50 or more. Adopting a guinea pig from a shelter or rescue organization is another option and can cost between $10 to $30.</p>
    <p class="mainP">In addition to the cost of the guinea pig itself, there are other expenses to consider, such as housing, food, bedding, and veterinary care. A cage suitable for one or two guinea pigs can cost anywhere from $30 to $100, depending on its size and features. Bedding materials such as wood shavings or paper-based products can cost between $10 to $20 per month.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Guinea pigs require a balanced diet that includes hay, fresh vegetables, and a small amount of pellets. The cost of their food will depend on the quality and quantity purchased. A bag of hay can cost between $5 to $20, while fresh vegetables can range from $5 to $10 per week. Pellets can cost between $10 to $20 per bag.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Routine veterinary care is necessary to keep your guinea pig healthy. Annual check-ups can cost between $50 to $100, while treatment for illnesses or injuries can cost significantly more. It is important to choose a veterinarian who is experienced in treating guinea pigs, as they have specific health needs.</p>
    <p class="mainP">Overall, the cost of owning a guinea pig can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars over its lifetime. Regular maintenance is also required, including cleaning the cage and providing fresh water and food daily. However, with proper care and attention, guinea pigs can make wonderful pets that provide years of companionship and entertainment.</p>
