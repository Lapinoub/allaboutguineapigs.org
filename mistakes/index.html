	<p class="mainP">Guinea pigs are adorable, friendly, and playful pets that make great companions. However, they are also delicate creatures that require specific care and handling. Here are some things to avoid doing to your guinea pigs:</p>
	<ol>
		<li class="mainP">Don't pick up your guinea pig by the scruff of its neck. Unlike cats, guinea pigs do not have a loose scruff of skin on their necks, so lifting them this way can cause serious injury.</li>
		<li class="mainP">Don't leave your guinea pigs in direct sunlight or extreme temperatures. Guinea pigs are sensitive to heat and can easily become overheated, which can lead to heat stroke. Similarly, exposure to extreme cold can cause them to become sick or even die.</li>
		<li class="mainP">Don't use cedar or pine shavings for bedding. These materials can cause respiratory problems and skin irritation in guinea pigs. Instead, opt for bedding made of paper, hay, or other safe materials.</li>
		<li class="mainP">Don't feed your guinea pigs foods that are harmful to them. Some foods that are safe for humans can be toxic to guinea pigs, including chocolate, avocado, and citrus fruits. Stick to a diet of hay, pellets, and fresh vegetables that are safe for guinea pigs.</li>
		<li class="mainP">Don't ignore signs of illness or injury. Guinea pigs can hide signs of illness or injury, so it's important to be vigilant and watch for any changes in behavior, appetite, or appearance. If you notice any signs of illness or injury, take your guinea pig to the vet right away.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="mainP">In conclusion, guinea pigs are lovable pets that require proper care and attention to thrive. Avoiding these common mistakes will help ensure that your guinea pig stays healthy and happy. Remember to always provide a safe and comfortable living environment, feed them a healthy diet, and monitor their health closely. With proper care and attention, your guinea pig can live a long and happy life.</p>
